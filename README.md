# PistonEntityCollisions

A simple Nukkit PM1 plugin to implement piston entity collision.
In the root directory, create a `lib` folder and place the `patched.jar` file from your PM1 server directory's `.cache` folder here.

### Addendum

Dear cloudburst, please cherry pick piston entity collisions from the ancient redstone branch. This plugin really shouldn't be a thing
